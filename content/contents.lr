title: Introduction

body:

The [SUSE-Enceladus](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus) organization in GitHub was created to serve the needs of the [SUSE Public Cloud](https://suse.com/public-cloud) Team. We started out with a "collector" project named Enceladus within the SUSE organization. Over time the collector project grew unwieldy and we had various unrelated source bases intermingled in the Enceladus project. In addition some of our other projects, large an small were maintained in separate projects in separate orgs. [SUSE-Enceladus](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus) was created to collect our efforts for original source code in one organization, help us be more organized, and provide a better overview of the projects we develop and maintain. The initial projects in this organization started as migrations from Enceladus or other projects we maintained in GitHub.

The project's namesake, _Enceladus_, is one of Jupiter's moons. Due to an ice crust, Enceladus is very reflective, making it easy to see despite its small size. Jupiter's gravity keeps this wet moon geologically active - causing geysers that shoot warm liquid up into it's thin cold atmosphere, which then falls back to the surface as snow. In essence, it's a heavenly body that perpetually generates _clouds_.

title: Goals
----
body:

We strive to provide a reasonably uniform experience for all projects within the [SUSE-Enceladus](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus) organization. In an effort to achieve this uniform experience we strive to document our processes and procedures. Each project will have a LICENSE, a README.md, and a CONTRIBUTING.md file that provides information about the project. However, projects do have different needs and therefore some differences are to be expected.

Projects in the [SUSE-Enceladus](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus) organization represent original work of the SUSE Public Cloud DevOps team. We hope our work is useful to you and we welcome any contribution. All projects here are in alignment with the [SUSE open source policy](https://opensource.suse.com/suse-open-source-policy) and as such we do not have a contributor agreement.
